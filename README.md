# kraken
Kraken is a cross-platform system programming language in the early development phase. It is entirely self-contained,
not relying on any external language tools such as Lex or Yacc. It is broadly based off of principles from the magnificent Red
Dragon Book and is suited to eventually be the implementation language for all of Darkside OS.
